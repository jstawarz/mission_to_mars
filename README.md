# Mission to Mars

## Overview of Project

In this project, we are working with Robin. Robin would like to develop a website that is dedicated to her astromony hobby, in particular Mars.
Her hope in creating this website will be to attract the attention of NASA, and hopefully lead to a position with the agency.

### Purpose

The purpose of this project will be to update the webpage with hemispheric images of Mars. To do this, we will use Beautiful Soup and Splinter
to scrape the new images, Mongo to store the images, Flask to display the data and Bootstrap to update the webpage.
